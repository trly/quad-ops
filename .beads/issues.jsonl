Add a small additional delay after all verifications complete (e.g., 50-100ms)\n2. Or: Try to actually call the unit operation (e.g., GetUnitProperty for ActiveState) to ensure it's fully loaded\n3.

For external networks marked as such in compose files, it incorrectly applies the current project's prefix:\n\n```go\nprojectNet, exists := project.Networks[networkName]\nif !exists {\n    resolvedName := service.SanitizeName(networkName)\n    if !strings.Contains(networkName, project.Name) {\n        resolvedName = service.SanitizeName(Prefix(project.Name, networkName))  // BUG HERE\n    }\n}\n```\n\nThis results in:\n- Compose file declares: `infrastructure-proxy` (external network from infrastructure project)\n- Code adds project prefix: `llm-infrastructure-proxy` (wrongly adds `llm-` prefix)\n- Actual network unit: `infrastructure_proxy.network` (created from infrastructure project with underscore)\n- Result: systemd unit references non-existent `llm-infrastructure-proxy.network`\n\n### Affected Services\nAny service that uses external networks from different projects:\n- llm services using `infrastructure-proxy`\n- scrutiny/dozzle/miniflux services using `infrastructure-proxy`\n- media services using `infrastructure-proxy`\n- beszel services using `infrastructure-proxy`\n\n### Evidence\nGenerated unit file: `~/.config/containers/systemd/llm-open-webui.container` references:\n```\nRequires=llm-infrastructure-proxy.network\nNetwork=llm-infrastructure-proxy.network\n```\n\nBut only `infrastructure_proxy.network` exists.\n\n## Solution\nFor external networks, use the network name as-is without applying the current project's prefix.

This is a system/kernel configuration issue, not a quad-ops bug.\n\n### Actual Error\n```\nError: rootlessport cannot expose privileged port 80, you can add 'net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80' to /etc/sysctl.conf (currently 1024)\n```\n\n### Affected Services\n- infrastructure-reverse-proxy (ports 80, 443)\n- Any other services binding to privileged ports\n\n### Solutions (System Configuration)\n1. **Recommended**: Configure unprivileged port access:\n   ```bash\n   sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80\n   sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80  # permanent\n   echo 'net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80' | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf\n   ```\n\n2. **Alternative**: Use port forwarding (e.g., firewall NAT from 80→8080)\n\n3. **Not recommended**: Run Podman in privileged mode (security risk)\n\n### Action Items\n- Document this in INSTALLATION.md or setup guide\n- Add to troubleshooting section of README\n- Clarify that this is system/kernel config, not quad-ops issue","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-11-09T10:36:47.80967079-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-09T12:31:55.281407967-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-09T12:31:55.281407967-05:00","source_repo":"."}
