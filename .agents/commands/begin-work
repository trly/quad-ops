Begin work on quad-ops-${ISSUE}. Review any associated design docs first and ask clarifying questions before beginning work.
As you are working, if you have any questions, stop and ask.

Write tests first that adhere to the established project testing patterns, then implement.
If any breaking changes are introduced, be sure to list them when implementation is complete.
